# Tic-Tac-Toe Game using React

This project is an implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using React. The game allows players to battle each other on the Tic-Tac-Toe board in real-time.

## Requirements

To run the game, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 12 or higher.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local computer:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AziAlex/TZ_Tic-Tac-Toe-Game.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd project-name
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running

After successfully installing dependencies, start the application locally with the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

Once started, open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to start playing Tic-Tac-Toe!

## How to Play

1. Upon opening the application, you'll see the game board divided into two sides for players X and O.
2. To make a move, click on any of the empty cells on the game board.
3. The game will automatically switch between players X and O.
4. When the game ends (someone wins or it's a draw), the result is displayed on both sides for 5 seconds before restarting the game.
5. Each round starts with a different player.
